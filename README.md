# Raspberry pi Home Aeroponic Farming

**Version 1.0.0**

A home aeroponic farming system designed for the Raspberry pi 3b+. The systems utilizes the raspberry pi's
GPIO to switch on and off a relay module to deliver power to a water pump and solenoid valve. The water pump
needs only to run approximately twice a day while delivering nutrients at 15 minute intervals for 2 seconds
durations. This will vary dependant on setup but can be used as a rough.
